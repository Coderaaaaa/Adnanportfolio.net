    <h1>Economics</h1>
    <h2>Muslims have helped South Africa’s economy by starting businesses and creating jobs. Some Muslim businesses are big companies with lots of workers, while others are small shops that help their local areas. By having these businesses, Muslims keep the economy strong and provide things that people need. 
        Some Muslim businesses focus on selling halal products, which are made according to Islamic rules. For example, halal food is very popular in South Africa, and many businesses sell halal meat, run restaurants, and offer other food products. These businesses don’t just serve Muslims many other South Africans enjoy halal food because it’s high quality.
