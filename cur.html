    <h1>Current Affairs</h1>
    <h2>Today, South Africa faces many problems like unemployment (people losing jobs) and poverty (not having enough money). Muslims have played a big role in helping people who are struggling. Many Muslim charities in South Africa work to provide food, clothing, and shelter to poor families. During the COVID 19 pandemic, these charities worked even harder to help people who were affected by the crisis. Muslim organizations also set up food drives and helped in hospitals, giving their time and effort to help their communities. Muslims are also involved in projects that help improve education and healthcare. There are programs where Muslim volunteers help children with their schoolwork or give out books and school supplies.</h2>
