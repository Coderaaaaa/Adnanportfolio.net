    <h1>Government</h1>
    <h2>South Africa is a democracy, which means that people vote for their leaders. Muslims have been involved in the government for many years. Some Muslims have worked in important government jobs, helping to make decisions that affect the whole country. For example, Ebrahim Rasool is a well known Muslim leader who was the Premier of the Western Cape. He worked to make sure that Muslims and people from other religions could live together peacefully. He also helped create rules that would benefit everyone and not just one group of people. Muslims in South Africa have also been involved in political groups. These groups work to get their ideas across to the government.</h2>
