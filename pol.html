    <h1>Politics</h1>
    <h2>In the past, South Africa had a system called “apartheid”. This system treated people unfairly because of their race. Many Muslims fought against apartheid because they believed it was wrong to treat people differently based on the color of their skin. One Muslim leader who stood up against apartheid was Imam Abdullah Haron. He was a religious leader who spoke out against racism. He even went to prison for his beliefs and sadly died there, but his reputation of fighting for justice continues. Today, Muslims in South Africa continue to be involved in politics, working to make sure that everyone is treated equally. They believe in standing up for justice and making sure that the government treats all people fairly.</h2>
